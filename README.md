# Loan-Approval-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This Machine Learning Project aims to predict whether an applicant will get a loan or not.
Log Transform , Mean , Mode methods were used to tackle the problem of missing values
Features like Credit_History , Loan_Amount played an important role in it. 
Later we plotted some countplots using library seaborn to know about the pattern:
1) Whether males are applying for loan more or women
2) Married indiviual applies for loan more or a Bachelor
3) Loan applicant is a self employed person or not
4) Loan applicant lies in which strata of the society whether urban , semi-urban or rural.

LabelEncoder , StandardScaler were used for preprocessing from sklearn.preprocessing 
Ensemble technique - RandomForestClassifier , DecisionTreeClassifier , GradientBoostingClassifier were used.
Regression Models - LogisticRegression was used.
adding to it naive bayes model - GaussianNB was also used for the prediction.
